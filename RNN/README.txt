## Intro
Code files for the LSTM and GRU.

## File Structure
Data should the IMDB review dataset, devided in two maps test and train. 
The data map should also contain a txt file of the word embeddings

./data/
  test/
  train/ 
  embedding.txt

the pickles map is needed in order to dump intermediate results. 


## Running files
To run the code, please open the TRAIN.ipynb 
To create plots, please open the PLOTS.ipynb
